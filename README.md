# XO Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the XO Game repository! This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe (also known as XO). It's developed using the PyQt5 framework, which provides a robust and user-friendly graphical user interface.

## Features
- Interactive and easy-to-use GUI.
- Two-player mode that allows you to play with a friend.

## Transformation to Executable
This Python project has been transformed into an executable (.exe) file using PyInstaller. This allows the game to be easily distributed and used without the need for a Python interpreter or any dependencies to be installed on the user's system.

## How to Play
1. Download the .exe file.
2. Run the .exe file to start the game.
3. Enjoy the game!

I hope you enjoy playing the XO game as much as I enjoyed developing it.
